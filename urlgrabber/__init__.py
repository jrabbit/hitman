"""A high-level cross-protocol url-grabber.

Using urlgrabber, data can be fetched in three basic ways:

  urlgrab(url) copy the file to the local filesystem
  urlopen(url) open the remote file and return a file object
     (like urllib2.urlopen)
  urlread(url) return the contents of the file as a string

When using these functions (or methods), urlgrabber supports the
following features:

  * identical behavior for http://, ftp://, and file:// urls
  * http keepalive - faster downloads of many files by using
    only a single connection
  * byte ranges - fetch only a portion of the file
  * reget - for a urlgrab, resume a partial download
  * progress meters - the ability to report download progress
    automatically, even when using urlopen!
  * throttling - restrict bandwidth usage
  * retries - automatically retry a download if it fails. The
    number of retries and failure types are configurable.
  * authenticated server access for http and ftp
  * proxy support - support for authenticated http and ftp proxies
  * mirror groups - treat a list of mirrors as a single source,
    automatically switching mirrors if there is a failure.
